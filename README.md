# SQL-For-Data-Analysis
This repo is based on the great FREE course by Udacity that can be found [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198)

Unfortuanetly the course is not thought in MySQL but it's in PostgreSQL. I changed everything to work with MySQL and also add some additioanl examples to the course plus tons of comments to make it more clear.

Hope it could be helpful.
