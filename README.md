# SQL-For-Data-Analysis
This repo is based on the great FREE course by Udacity that can be found [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198)

Unfortuanetly the course is not thought in MySQL but it's in PostgreSQL. I changed everything to work with MySQL and also add some additioanl examples to the course plus tons of comments to make it more clear.

Hope it could be helpful.

1. Run the `1.parch-and-posey.sql` in your MySQL to create the data we'll work with in the upcoming lessons (This file is mdified to run in MySQL).
2. '2.Udacity_Join.sql' covers topics including Inner, Left and Right Joins.
